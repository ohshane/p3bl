# Goals

- Develop an AI-driven learning platform that personalizes educational content based on individual learner needs and preferences
- Create an interactive learning environment that fosters engagement through gamification, quizzes, and real-time feedback
- Ensure accessibility for learners of all backgrounds, including those with disabilities
- Integrate a community hub for peer-to-peer learning, discussion forums, and collaborative projects

# Non-Goals

- Building a traditional Learning Management System (LMS) without AI capabilities
- Focusing solely on content delivery without interactive elements or learner engagement features
- Targeting only a specific age group or educational level; the platform aims to be versatile for all learners
